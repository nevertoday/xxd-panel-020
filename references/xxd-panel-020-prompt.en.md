# XXD Panel 020 | Minimal Abstract-Memory Editorial Production Prompt

## Runtime complete-canvas contract — highest priority

- `TOP_BOTTOM` and `LEFT_RIGHT` default to one complete finished generation using the current source as a high-fidelity edit/reference input. Do not pre-split the job into photographic and design halves.
- Top-bottom keeps the faithful source in approximately the upper 50% and performs this style transformation below; left-right uses the faithful source in approximately the left 50% and the transformation on the right. Unify both regions through colour, light, rhythm, typography, and meaning.
- `DESIGN_ONLY` and `WALLPAPER_PACK` use the complete canvas while the source remains an invisible identity/content reference. Recompose every wallpaper separately for its device.
- `FINAL CANVAS` means the ratio/pixels of the whole finished artwork and must be explicitly resolved before generation; never apply source dimensions silently. `DESIGN FRAME` is used only if a failed complete-canvas retry triggers deterministic composition fallback.
- Retry a failed complete canvas once against the failed constraint only. Scripted composition is allowed only after that retry still fails, when pixel-identical source preservation is explicitly required, when the active route cannot realise the canvas, or for lossless pixel calibration.

### Model priority and credentials

- **Prefer GPT Image 2.** When GPT Image 2 is available through the current built-in image tool or a configured compatible route, use it first for the high-fidelity reference/edit and complete-canvas generation required by this prompt.
- Also support Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model only when the actual route can preserve the source, realise the whole finished canvas, render the target-language text, and accept the multiple references needed by a linked wallpaper pack.
- An alternative model changes only the generation route. It must not change this prompt's modes, canvas, source visibility, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or complete-canvas-first / composition-fallback-only logic. Do not silently downgrade a hard requirement.
- If no suitable route is available, ask the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task, but never echo, display, log, or expose their value in chat, prompts, or diagnostics. Do not persist them or modify global route configuration unless explicitly requested.
- Judge availability by actual image capability, not by a provider name or one missing environment variable.

Process only the one source photograph explicitly supplied for this current task. Lock the principal subject or inseparable relation, silhouette, pose, action, space, and narrative relation. Preserve at least three source-specific structural cues. Never borrow a form, palette, copy, or composition from old outputs, samples, or another input.

## Deconstruct → select → distil → reconstruct

Deconstruct the source into mass proportions, primary and secondary axes, key curves, openings, interlocks, layers, occlusions, negative spaces, scale differences, distances, and asymmetric balance. Select only the few facts essential to recognition and memory, distil each selected fact into one clear geometric role, then reconstruct one coherent abstract memory rather than diagramming every part.

People retain pose, orientation, body or clothing mass, and relational distance; animals retain body rhythm and head direction; plants retain growth curve; architecture retains skyline, axes, and defining openings; objects and vehicles retain functional mass and negative shape; landscapes retain a source-specific horizon, terrain curve, or spatial relation.

The source correspondence must be felt at a glance without completing every contour. Every form carries identity, weight, action, spatial relation, or memory; no shape exists merely to look modern.

## Few forms, one visual memory

Use a small disciplined vocabulary of circles, ellipses, rectangles, bars, arcs, wedges, irregular planes, or custom simple contours. Introduce a form only when it directly represents a locked structural fact.

Preserve the source's most distinctive ratios and relations: long axis against compact mass, curve against bar, opening inside body, one form passing behind another, a blocked edge, narrow gap, or deliberate imbalance. Flat overlap and extremely restrained spatial cues are allowed; gradients, photoreal volume, and 3D objects are not.

Compose around one visual centre through scale difference, primary/secondary hierarchy, positive/negative form, occlusion, alignment, and breathing rhythm. Preserve a large clean ivory ground. Reject even distribution, filling empty space, fragmented debris, equal modules, iconification, logo marks, and stock Bauhaus compositions.

## Strict source-derived colour roles

All colour comes from the source and resolves into one main colour, one dark structural colour, and one light or neutral colour. Add at most one small key accent only when clearly supported by the source.

Preserve the source's most recognisable and spirited colour rather than averaging pixels or greying the whole palette. Build hierarchy through area proportion, value relationship, and local contrast: the main colour carries memory, the dark anchors axes, occlusion, or type, and the light or neutral opens space.

Keep the ivory ground visibly distinct from the light form. Reject equal colour shares, indiscriminate multicolour, fixed palettes, digital gradients, atmospheric shading, muddy ageing, and decorative colour unsupported by the source.

## Editorial microtypography

Obey the resolved automatic, exact-user, or text-free copy mode and target language or locale. Preserve exact user wording verbatim. In text-free mode render no letter, character, number, text, or pseudo-text.

Automatic copy distils one poetic 2–5-word title from source light, space, action, material, relation, or emotion, then adds two to four microtext groups. Supporting groups may use a short phrase, state word, user-supplied or established place/object information, compositional index, chapter mark, sequence code, scale-like number, direction word, material word, archival label, or micro-explanation.

Automatic copy never invents or uses a year. Places, dates, provenance, and factual numbers must be user-supplied or reliably established. Exact user wording remains verbatim even when it contains a year; the no-year rule constrains automatic invention and never overrides the user's text.

The title carries emotion; microtype carries order, evidence, material, sequence, and reading rhythm. Align type along geometric axes, edges, contours, colour blocks, or negative space. Use vertical setting, rotation, columns, tracking, edge attachment, corner pressure, crossing, nesting, or alignment only when native to the script and structurally useful. Include deliberate scale contrast between at least one very small and one slightly larger group.

Use native equivalents of restrained serif and slender editorial type for the target script. Never force Latin tracking, rotation, or small caps onto Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Arabic, and never use a generic bold display face, UI type, glow, extrusion, or pasted label.

## Mode and acceptance


Hard gate: at least three source structural cues; a visible deconstruct–select–distil–reconstruct logic; few forms, one visual memory, strong scale hierarchy, clear positive/negative form, and generous ivory space; source-earned mass ratios, axes, curves, interlocks, layers, occlusions, negative space, and asymmetry; strict main + dark structural + light/neutral colour roles with at most a small accent; a 2–5-word title and two to four accurate microtext groups form a reading path; no invented year in automatic copy and exact user wording remains verbatim; no generic icon, logo, even arrangement, fragment pile, meaningless circle-and-bar set, overall greying, gradient, complex collage, commercial template, photo fragment, or pseudo-text.

If any hard condition fails, correct the generated asset. Never fake the artwork with programmatic drawing, SVG, HTML, Canvas, or a post-composited type overlay.
